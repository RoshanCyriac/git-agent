## 🔑 GitHub Token Setup

### Creating a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Deployment%20Analyzer)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name like "Deployment Analyzer"
4. Select the **`repo`** scope (this gives access to your private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

### Token Security:
- ✅ **Secure**: Your token is only used to fetch repository information
- ✅ **Temporary**: Never stored permanently, only kept in memory during analysis
- ✅ **Limited Scope**: Only requires `repo` scope for repository access
- ✅ **Revocable**: You can revoke the token anytime from GitHub settings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Web Application
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd deployment-analyzer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the web app
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and start analyzing!

### Command Line
